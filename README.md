## OO Principles

* Encapsulates what varies.
* Favor composition over inheritance.
* Program to interfaces, not implementations.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.
* Principle of Least Knowledge: talk only to your immediate friends.
* The Hollywood Principle: Don't call us, we'll call you.
* A class should have only one reason to change.
